This is a minimalist's editor. Keep it that way. Do not turn it into ex,
or vi, or emacs, all of which already exist!

Consider rewriting in Java and use an ArrayList of Strings
(first use an Array of Strings, as a migration path).

Write large-memory buffer prims, using linked list instead of array.

Use pointers, not arrays, in buffer structure.

Code cleanup:
	Report the error if you exceed MAXLINE (or fix bufprim as above).
	Enforce one-exit-from-function.
	Use typedefs for status, lineno.

Rewr.c:
	add popens so can use r !date, w !wc -l, etc (I had this in '84).
	check that file exists before overwriting it!!

More test cases!
