This is a minimalist's editor. Keep it that way. Do not turn it into ex,
or vi, or emacs, all of which already exist!

Write large-memory buffer prims, using linked list instead of array.

Use pointers, not arrays, in buffer structure.

Code cleanup:
	Report the error if you exceed MAXLINE (or fix bufprim as above).
	Enforce one-exit-from-function.
	Use typedefs for status, lineno.
	cb -sj where needed.
