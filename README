This is a simple line editor, similar to UNIX ed(1).
I wrote this back in the early 1980's based on the editor
in the books Software Tools and Software Tools in Pascal.

It contains no AT&T/Weco/USL/Univell/Novell source code.

Geoff Collyer typed it in again in 1994, from some listings of mine
dated 1983, after the online source got lost in the sands of time. Geoff
also found a few bugs and suggested improvements to the decade-old code
he started with - Thanks Geoff!

The source is still in flux and needs lotsa work - see TODO.
